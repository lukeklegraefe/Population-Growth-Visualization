# Population-Growth-Visualization
Small visualization of country population growths.

Working on data visualization in python for my data analytics class at UMD.
The country .csv file contains data for many countries, but I chose just to compare the US and China.

NOTE: The "data+visualization+with+python.ipynb" file was not from me, and was provided via CS Dojo site which hosts data
like this for people to use in their learning projects.
